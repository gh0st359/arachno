	Features
 • Multi-Threaded Fuzzing:
Leverages Python’s ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent requests, significantly speeding up testing.
	•	Advanced Vulnerability Detection:
Detects a variety of vulnerabilities including:
	•	Open Redirects
	•	Local File Inclusion (LFI)
	•	Reflected Input vulnerabilities
	•	Possible Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
	•	SQL Injection errors
	•	Command Injection hints
	•	Flexible Input Modes:
Supports GET, POST, and COOKIE fuzzing using a simple FUZZ placeholder in target URLs, data, or cookie strings.
	•	Random User-Agent Rotation:
Mimic real-world traffic by rotating through a list of common User-Agent strings.
	•	Customizable:
Configure custom headers, proxies, delays, and timeouts to suit your testing environment.
	•	Logging & Reporting:
Optionally log detailed results to a file for further analysis.

	Usage

Arachno is executed from the command line. It accepts various arguments to customize its operation.

Basic Command Structure

python arachno.py --url "http://example.com/page?param=FUZZ" --wordlist payloads.txt --method GET

Command-Line Arguments
	•	--url:
The target URL containing the FUZZ placeholder for injection.
	•	--data:
(For POST method) The POST data string with FUZZ placeholder.
	•	--cookies:
(For COOKIE method) The cookie string with FUZZ placeholder.
	•	--wordlist:
Path to a file containing payloads (one per line).
	•	--method:
Fuzzing method. Choose from GET, POST, or COOKIE.
	•	--threads:
Number of concurrent threads (default: 20).
	•	--proxy:
Proxy URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080).
	•	--headers:
Custom headers in the format Key:Value.
	•	--timeout:
Request timeout in seconds (default: 10).
	•	--delay:
Delay between requests in seconds (default: 0).
	•	--random-agent:
Enable random User-Agent rotation for each request.
	•	--output:
File path to log the results.

	Configuration Options

You can tailor Arachno to your specific testing needs by configuring:
	•	Thread Count:
Increase threads to speed up testing or decrease to reduce load.
	•	Request Timeout & Delay:
Set custom timeouts and delays to accommodate slower networks or to avoid detection.
	•	Custom Headers & Proxies:
Add custom headers or route traffic through a proxy to simulate different environments.
	•	User-Agent Rotation:
Enable random User-Agent rotation to mimic diverse clients and evade simple security filters.

	Examples

GET Fuzzing with Random User-Agent and Logging

python arachno.py --url "http://example.com/search?q=FUZZ" --wordlist payloads.txt --method GET --threads 30 --random-agent --output results.log

POST Fuzzing with Custom Headers

python arachno.py --url "http://example.com/login" --data "username=admin&password=FUZZ" --wordlist payloads.txt --method POST --headers "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --threads 15

COOKIE Fuzzing through a Proxy

python arachno.py --url "http://example.com/dashboard" --cookies "session=FUZZ" --wordlist payloads.txt --method COOKIE --proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
